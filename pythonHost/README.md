# pykidev

**pykidev** is a lightweight Python driver and communication layer for Arduino-based laboratory instruments, developed as part of the **SMILE (Scalable Modular Instrumentation for Laboratory Experiments)** project.

It provides:
- A simple serial communication interface (`Pykiba`)
- Automatic discovery and binding of Arduino commands (`PykiDev`)
- Optional network access via ZeroRPC for distributed control

The goal is to bridge fast Arduino prototyping with flexible Python-based experiment control, without the overhead of large frameworks.

## Installation

There are two main ways to install and use the project.

---

### 1. Install full project (recommended)

Clone the repository and install it using pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs the package in editable mode.

Optional (with Jupyter support):

```bash
pip install -e .[client]
```

---

### 2. Manual installation of dependencies

If you prefer to install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install pyserial zerorpc fire msgpack pyzmq
```

Optional (for UI and plotting):

```bash
pip install jupyter matplotlib ipywidgets
```

---

## Quick usage

### Direct (centralized mode)

```python
from pykidev import PykiDev

ard = PykiDev('/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate=9600)
print(ard.hello())
```

---

### Distributed mode (ZeroRPC server)

Start server:

```bash
smile --n=0 --baudrate=9600 --bind_port=2020
```

Or:

```bash
python smile.py --n=0 --baudrate=9600 --bind_port=2020
```

---

## Architecture

- **Pykiba** → low-level serial transport and parsing  
- **PykiDev** → dynamic command interface (auto-generated from Arduino)  
- **smile.py** → deployment layer (CLI + ZeroRPC server)

This design allows seamless transition from local scripts to distributed laboratory systems.

---

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.8  
- Arduino device running a compatible command interpreter (e.g. CmdArduino)

## Notes

This project is designed for small-scale experimental setups where simplicity, flexibility, and rapid development are more important than heavy infrastructure.
